This repo is my first Discord Bot ever, and I had plenty of fun and FAST!

# INSTALL


First Create#/have handy a new Discord Bot. Bot should have rights as described in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onDGOVqq-00) (basically, read history messages and write messages). Have all IDs handy.

* `cp .envrc.private.dist .envrc.private` and edit away.
* `bundle install` # better from rbenv rather than system ruby..
* `./magic.sh` 

# Inspiration

Amazing video to do DiscordBot on Ruby! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onDGOVqq-00
